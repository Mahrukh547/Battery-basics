BATTERY  MANAGEMENT  SYSTEMS IN A TRAILER


OVERVIEW & MAIN FEATURES :
The idea of the project is to design a battery management system for a trailer in terms of cost and energy efficiency to ensure sustainability for the tourist and passengers using the trailer.
The load comprises of some basics like cooking ,Mobile /Laptop Charging and lights .The solar light provides energy to charge the batteries installed inside the trailer .The main features and 
parameters to supply sufficient energy are Voltage ,Current , Irradiance from Solar cell and MPPT then SOC ,temperature ,Voltage ,Current from batteries and the load power based on the electrical formula of  
P=V*I where , V is voltage and I is current.


IMPLEMENTATION:
The main components and implementation was basically simulation from MATLAB which then involves intelligent communication using MQTTBox , ESP-32 Node MCU and finally a user-interface dashboard at NETPIE.
In MQTTBox we made two clients one is ESP the other is MATLAB getting subscribe and publish from topic @msg/solar/battery/load/LEDStatus which is also defined in Arduino IDE. The main  information
displayed on NETPIE dashboard are energy remaining for ‘X’ hours in a trailer. Other parameters displayed on the trailer are Solar Voltage, current and Irradiance from Solar then SOC ,temperature ,Voltage ,
Current from batteries and the load power .One additional feature is is BMS protection we can switch ON/OFF the simulation from NETPIE & from MATLAB as well.All the source codes and files for this project
implementation can be found in the Github repository most important files are MATLAB Simulation By Lara, Updated version of the Simulation ,Code for time calculation(Mahrukh),Final.ino ,ESP-32 TO NETPIE(Random).ino,shadowmay.ino
MATLAB.ino and MATLAB to uc.m and MATLAB to uc.slx.For the weekly updates and details how it was implemented and what were the steps taken please see below.

WEEKLY UPDATES
15-January 2024- 22 January 2024 : Idea forming and team forming and topic selection
22 Jan - 19 Feb 2024 : Working on Python script to write up the code for battery management system + weather forecast information that receives data from MYSQL
19 Feb - 11 March : Worked on the implementation of batteries in Python the work involves battery health monitoring (inlcuding parameters based on state of the charge , temperature, current 
and voltage and energy remaining with time calculation ) alongwith weather forecasting.
11 March - 18 March : Issues encountering with estabilsihing connection of Python with MQTT and NETPIE although a GUI Screen was formed in Visual Studio code already.
18 March and onwards: Reconsidered MATLAB on the account of ESP-32 conneection for that I had to install MATLAB thrice ,real time calculation in MATLAB
25 March 2024 - 1 April 2024 :Making simple simulation of MATLAB ,trial and error for ESP-32 connection , tried ThingsPeak IoT for dashbboard as an alternative for NETPIE but all efforts in vain.
1 April - 8 April 2024: Designed simulation of solar,battery and all the connected loads in MATLAB ,estabilshed connection between MATLAB,ESP-32 and NETPIE.Successfully parsed data from ESP sent 
viceversa but error connecting to NETPIE.Had reconsidered the idea of incorporating sensors based on the idea of sending data from microcontroller to MATLAB but turned down 
after discussing it with Professor Chayakorn.The idea of incorporating sensors came after reading datasheet of ESP.
8 April -15 April 2024: Updated operating system and installed ESPRESS-IF IDF for python and installed relevant libraries for python estabilishment to MQTT and NETPIE.Successfully displayed results
to NETPIE from Python via MQTT and ESP-32.However, MATLAB was decided and had errors in MATLAB , fixed them.
15 April - 22 April 2024 :Worked on ESP-32 and NETPIE dashboard , created a random function that displays and dynamically changes value within a range of parameters defined.
Additionally worked on parameters of BMS to control switch from NETPIE ON/OFF state ,finally combined these two codes together under the file of 1 may 2024 in repository section of GitHub.
22 April - 29 April 2024: Deployed successful connection from ESP-32 to arduino , updated a dasboard in NETPIE ,successfully estabilished connection from MATLAB to ESP-32,also developed an LED switch button
to stop simulation.
29 April - 6 May 2024:Write up of a code that retrieves data from MATLAB , brings it to esp and displays results to NETPIE.Additionally worked on a feature that 
calculates energy remaining in a trailer with time left.
6 May -12 May 2024: Working on final report(github) and presentation

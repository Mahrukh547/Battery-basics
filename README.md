# Battery-basics
The project aims about creating charging process of the battery based on the voltage levels e.g 3.0 Volts is the minimum voltage level and above 3.7 Volts is the highest level of auto-cut off signals.Any voltage above 3.7 volts is considered to be accounted for auto-cut off levels.

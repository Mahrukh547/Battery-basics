WEEKLY UPDATE 
15-January 2024- 22 January 2024 : Idea forming and team forming and topic selection
22 Jan - 19 Feb 2024 : Working on Python script to write up the code for battery management system + weather forecast information that receives data from MYSQL
19 Feb - 11 March : Worked on the implementation of batteries in Python the work involves battery health monitoring (inlcuding parameters based on state of the charge , temperature, current 
and voltage and energy remaining with time calculation ) alongwith weather forecasting.
11 March - 18 March : Issues encountering with estabilsihing connection of Python with MQTT and NETPIE although a GUI Screen was formed in Visual Studio code already.
18 March and onwards: Reconsidered MATLAB on the account of ESP-32 conneection for that I had to install MATLAB thrice ,real time calculation in MATLAB
25 March 2024 - 1 April 2024 :Making simple simulation of MATLAB ,trial and error for ESP-32 connection , tried ThingsPeak IoT for dashbboard as an alternative for NETPIE but all efforts in vain.
1 April - 8 April 2024: Designed simulation of solar,battery and all the connected loads in MATLAB ,estabilshed connection between MATLAB,ESP-32 and NETPIE.Successfully parsed data from ESP sent 
viceversa but error connecting to NETPIE.Had reconsidered the idea of incorporating sensors based on the idea of sending data from microcontroller to MATLAB but turned down 
after discussing it with Professor Chayakorn.The idea of incorporating sensors came after reading datasheet of ESP.
8 April -15 April 2024: Updated operating system and installed ESPRESS-IF IDF for python and installed relevant libraries for python estabilishment to MQTT and NETPIE.Successfully displayed results
to NETPIE from Python via MQTT and ESP-32.However, MATLAB was decided and had errors in MATLAB , fixed them.
15 April - 22 April 2024 :Worked on ESP-32 and NETPIE dashboard , created a random function that displays and dynamically changes value within a range of parameters defined.
Additionally worked on parameters of BMS to control switch from NETPIE ON/OFF state ,finally combined these two codes together under the file of 1 may 2024 in repository section of GitHub.
22 April - 29 April 2024: Deployed successful connection from ESP-32 to arduino , updated a dasboard in NETPIE ,successfully estabilished connection from MATLAB to ESP-32,also developed an LED switch button
to stop simulation.
29 April - 6 May 2024:
